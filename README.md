This project is a personal webpage dedicated to someone I admire, built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, React, and JavaScript. It highlights the person's admirable qualities, includes images, and features a responsive, visually appealing design. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, making the layout flexible and modern, while React and JavaScript power interactive elements on the page.
